        <p>Is your bike the right size? To check, see Section 3.A. If your bicycle is too
          large or too small for you, you may lose control and fall. If your new bike is not
          the right size, ask your dealer to exchange it before you ride it.</p>
          <p>Is the saddle at the right height? To check, see Section 3.B. If you adjust
            your saddle height, follow the Minimum Insertion instructions in Section 3.B.</p>

                <li>Are saddle and seat post securely clamped? A correctly tightened saddle will
                  allow no saddle movement in any direction. See Section 3.B</li>

        <p>Always wear an approved helmet when riding your bike, and follow the

          <p>Do you have all the other required and recommended safety equipment?
            See Section 2. Its your responsibility to familiarize yourself with the laws of the
            areas where you ride, and to comply with all applicable laws</p>

        <p>Make sure nothing is loose. Lift the front wheel off the ground by two or three
          inches, then let it bounce on the ground. Anything sound, feel or look loose? Do
          a visual and tactile inspection of the whole bike. Any loose parts or accessories?
          If so, secure them. If you’re not sure, ask someone with experience to check.</p>
          <p>Tires in good shape? Spin each wheel slowly and look for cuts in the tread
            and sidewall. Replace damaged tires before riding the bike</p>

        <p>When you buckle on your helmet and go for your first familiarization ride on
          your new bicycle, be sure to pick a controlled environment, away from cars, other
          cyclists, obstacles or other hazards. Ride to become familiar with the controls,
          features and performance of your new bike</p>
          <p>Familiarize yourself with the braking action of the bike (see Section 4.C). Test
            the brakes at slow speed, putting your weight toward the rear and gently applying
            the brakes, rear brake first. Sudden or excessive application of the front brake
            could pitch you over the handlebars</p>

        <p>Always wear a cycling helmet which meets the latest
          certification standards and is appropriate for the type of riding you
          do. Always follow the helmet manufacturer’s instructions for fit,
          use and care of your helmet. Most serious bicycle injuries involve head injuries
          which might have been avoided if the rider had worn an appropriate helmet.</p>
          <p>Always do the Mechanical Safety Check (Section 1.C) before you get on a
            bike</p>
